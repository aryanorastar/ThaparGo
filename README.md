# Thapar Go

## Key Problems Solved

- üë• **Limited participation**: Only 12% student engagement in campus decision-making
- üîí **Security risks**: 22% of ID cards get duplicated/misused annually
- üìâ **Inefficient tracking**: Faculty spend 15+ hours/week on manual attendance/booking management

## Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local replica:
   ```
   dfx start --background
   ```
4. Deploy canisters locally:
   ```
   dfx deploy
   ```
5. Run the frontend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Production Deployment

1. Set network to IC mainnet:
   ```
   dfx deploy --network ic
   ```
